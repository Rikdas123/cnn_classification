# cnn_classification
CNN model developed frrom scratch for binary classification: 
Developed a CNN ML model from scratch using linear convolution which can classify between two well differentiable objects. The model is trained and tested on two pairs of datasets, dog-cat dataset (contains 25000 real images of cats and dogs)[testing accuracy 92%] and horse-human dataset(contains 2000 AI generated images of horses and humans)[testing accuracy 97%].
